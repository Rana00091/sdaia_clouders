# Program Overview

## Program Description

Cloud development is the foundation for leveraging the power of AI.  This program is called “Clouder” which takes you from fundamentals to the advanced level of Google Cloud. The program uses engaging videos, labs, in-person and online lessons to teach you comprehensive topics and to prepare you for the following certificates: 

### 1. Associate cloud engineer certificate

### 2. Professional data engineer certificate.

Google is leading the learning for this program and provides you with a project-based approach for Learning, helps you retain information better, and gives you valuable experience building things in the cloud, so you’re better prepared to bring your new skills to bear in your day-to-day work and enhance your future career.

## Program  Overview

This program is a national project that aims at spreading the technical knowledge and understanding for the cloud, AI & ML in the Kingdom and helping you to gain cloud experience that is required in all fields nowadays.

*Level 1 (Associate Cloud Engineer): Get started with Google Cloud training by completing the fundamentals of Google Cloud and learn how to deploy applications, monitor operations and manage enterprise applications through Coursera courses which leads you at the end to get the Associate Cloud Engineer certification
*Level 2 (Professional Data Engineer 1/2): In this level you will experiment with end-to-end machine learning on Google Cloud, starting from building a machine learning-focused strategy and progressing into model training, optimization, and productionalization.
*Level 3 (Professional Data Engineer 2/2): In this level you will be able to design, build, operationalize, secure, and monitor data processing systems with a particular emphasis on security and compliance; scalability and efficiency; reliability and fidelity; and flexibility and portability

## Level 2: Professional Data engineer 1/2

At this level, the 100 Certified Google Associate Cloud Engineers will have Instructor-led Classroom Training.

Overview: What is machine learning and what kinds of problems can it solve? Google thinks about machine learning slightly differently -- of being about logic, rather than just data. We talk about why such a framing is useful when thinking about building a pipeline of machine learning models. In this course, you will experiment with end-to-end machine learning on Google Cloud, starting from building a machine learning-focused strategy and progressing into model training, optimization, and production.

## Level 3: Professional Data engineer 2/2
Overview: A Professional Data Engineer enables data-driven decision-making by collecting, transforming, and publishing data. A data engineer should be able to design, build, operationalize, secure, and monitor data processing systems with a particular emphasis on security and compliance; scalability and efficiency; reliability and fidelity; and flexibility and portability. A data engineer should also be able to leverage, deploy, and continuously train pre-existing machine learning models.

At this level, the participants will attend Professional Data Engineer to cover the following:
